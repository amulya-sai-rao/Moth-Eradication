# Moth-Eradication
Python Project - Eradication Program

Entomologists in the Northeast have set out traps to determine the influx of Jolliet moths into the area. They plan to study eradication programs that have some potential to control the spread of the moth population. The study calls for organizing the traps in which moths have been caught into compact regions, which will then be used to test each eradication program. A region is defined as the polygon with the minimum length perimeter that can enclose all traps within that region.
